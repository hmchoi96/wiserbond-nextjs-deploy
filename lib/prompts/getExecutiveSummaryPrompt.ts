  - (Not required, but) consider using bullet points if clarity improves.
  - Limit your summary to **3â€“5 sentences**, suitable for an executive dashboard or report header.
  - Focus on the most actionable, directional implications from the combined analysis.
  - If any insights were inferred from fallback or historical comparisons due to lack of recent data, briefly indicate this.
  - Do NOT include citations, detailed explanations, or qualifiers unless essential to the message.
  - Maintain a high-level, strategic tone. Avoid emotional or editorial framing.
  - Your response should resemble an executive memo, not a paragraph-style article.
